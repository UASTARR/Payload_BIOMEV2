system config
    00h mode register, only slightly care
    0Bh Output Port Configuration and Phase control, I think I might need this

interrupt based motor control
    04h int mode, should be fine with stock values
    05h mask interrupt, bits 1 and 0 but be changed to 0 for the respective I/O pins to send interrupts
    08h interrupt based motor control, this is the big one and 6 of the 8 bits matter
    09h lets me add some extra motor steps after intP0
    0Ah lets me add some extra motor steps after intP1

non interropt based control
    12h and 13h number of clockwise steps, 16 bit value
    14h and 15h number of counter-clockwise steps, 16 bit value
    16h and 17h clockwise step pulse width, lets us set the motor speed
    18h and 19h counter-clockwise step pulse width, lets us set the speed
    1Ah Motor control register, this is where we tell it to start and stop the motor and which way to turn

Testing and debugging only
    03h I/O config, only care about this for debugging my code and not final motor control
    06h int status, read only but I will want to work with this during systems testing
    07h input port, read only but will let me check the state
    1Fh, 20h, 21h, and 22h step counter, a 32 bit read only counter that clears after read telling you how many steps the motor has taken
